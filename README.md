# Understanding Quaternions

Bascially, a quaternion is a method to express **orientation** (a person in the same spot looking another direction would have a different orientation). 
Alternative methods to express oreientations would be 
**Euler Angles, **


## Quaternions are expressed in the form of
1. a + b**i**  + c**j** + d**k**
2. cos(\theta) + sin(\theta) {\alpha **i** + \beta **j** + \gamma **k**}
3. dd


## To do rotations!
